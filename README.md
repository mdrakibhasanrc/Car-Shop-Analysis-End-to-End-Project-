# Title: Car Shop Analysis(End-to-End Project)

# Introduction: 
I'm thrilled to share the successful completion of my latest project, where I dived into the world of automotive data analysis. Here's a quick rundown of the journey.

# Problems Statment:
As a car dealership owner, I want to analyze and optimize our Car Shop analysis and maximize profitability and customer satisfaction. Determine the ideal pricing for each car model, taking into account factors such as the model year, brand, mileage, and certification status. The aim is to set competitive prices that attract customers while maximizing our profit margins.
KPI & Metrics:
1. Max and Min Price
2. Average Review and Rating
3. Average Mileage
4. Top 5 Brands by Avg Price
5. Car Stock by Price Group (%)
6. Top 5 Dealer by total number of cars
7. Certified Car(%)
8. Avg mileage by Car Brands
9. Total number of cars for each rating group



# Tools Used: 
1. Data Extract, Transform & Load (Python)
2. Data Export (Google Bigquery)
3. Data Visualization(Tableau)

# üìä Data Collection: 
I used Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape valuable car data from car.com.

# üîÑ Data Transformation: 
With the power of Pandas and NumPy, I performed some serious data magic. I cleaned, transformed, and prepared the data for the next step.

# üè¢ Data Warehousing:
The transformed data found its new home in Google BigQuery, where it's stored securely and ready for analysis.


# üîç Data Analysis: 
BigQuery was the perfect playground for exploring and analyzing the data. Insights and patterns emerged, shedding light on the fascinating world of car shopping.


# üìà Data Visualization:
To make these insights shine, I turned to Tableau for data visualization. The visuals brought the story to life, making it easier to understand and share.
